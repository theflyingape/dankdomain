All prior deeds will be zeroed and everyone will start off as a Novice player, regardless.\nIf you have not played in a while, you still have some 'dress rehearsal' time before the playing board is reset. Come join the party! And speaking of parties, if you are not a member of a gang, consider starting a new one or joining up in an open spot.\n\n\thttps://robert.hurst-ri.us/games/dankdomain \n\nFor the latest developments with 🔥 Dank Domain 🔥 \n\n\thttps://www.npmjs.com/package/dankdomain \n\nHappy hunting!"
