Welcome to the party!

It benefits you and your party when you WIN:

- relative experience is awarded to all participating members;
  pay attention to how much experience is needed to advance to the
  next level versus the sum of levels ratio between the parties

- any money looted is distributed to surviving members, by level,
  and a much smaller portion to the defeated members

- active members in your gang can help each other quickly advance,
  plunder, and gloat by partying successfully on each visit

... but also be warned that:

- advanced attack spells are often used to hinder, if not harass,
  another player -- without Arena's lower-than-3 level limit

- rival gangs will seek the same benefits from you

- there are imposed consequences when attacking a fellow gang member
