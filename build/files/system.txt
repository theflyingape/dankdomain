This game runs on in the Google Cloud Platform using 1 shared vCPU core
with 0.6gb RAM out of Iowa (us-central1).

The game was re-imagined using Node.js and the TypeScript transpiler.
The portal door uses the latest xterm.js with a node-pty implementation.
The telnet service allows for a classic, "old school" gaming experience.
