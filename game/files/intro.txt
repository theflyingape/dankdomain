This cloud server is dedicated to run this fine Role-Playing Game.

Its main theme and purpose is to provide a fantasy, medieval setting for the
players (YOU) to interact with one another in fights, jousts, brawls, and other
explorations.  While the action here can get hot, this game provides an
excellent source of playful recreation between adolescents and adults.

The object of this game is to ascend in experience levels until reaching level
100.  There, you re-roll, but with the chance to become a powerful Paladin,
Titan, or God immortal class.

The first player to roll as a God wins the game and the board is reset.

You begin as a Novice class adventurer and your assigned ability points define
your capabilities.  A good place to begin your quest is in the Arena where you
can joust another user.  If successful, you can win money from the contest to
buy items from the Town Square.  The rest is up to you to explore on your own.

Happy Hunting!
