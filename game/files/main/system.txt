This game runs on the Google Cloud Platform, using 1 shared vCPU core
with 0.6gb RAM out of Iowa (us-central1).

The game was re-imagined using Node.js with the TypeScript transpiler.
The portal door uses the Xterm.js emulator with a node-pty implementation.
The telnet service allows for a classic, "old school" gaming experience.
