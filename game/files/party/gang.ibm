[1;32m--[22m>[2m>[22m  Welcome to the party !!

[36mIt benefits you and your party when you [1mWIN[22m:
[m
- relative experience is awarded to all participating members;
  pay attention to how much experience is needed to advance to the
  next level versus the sum-of-level ratio between the parties

- any money looted is distributed to surviving members, by level,
  with a much smaller portion to the defeated members

- active members in your gang can help each other quickly advance,
  plunder, and gloat by partying successfully on each visit

[33m... but also be warned that:
[m
- advanced attack spells are often used to hinder, if not harass,
  another player -- without Arena's lower-than-3 level limit

- rival gangs will seek the same benefits from you

- there are imposed consequences when attacking a fellow gang member
